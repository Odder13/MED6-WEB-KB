## Instructions
To start the server and open the website in your browser, follow these steps:
- Download the repository from GitHub. 
- Open two terminals.
- In one terminal direct to `\backend`, then run `node index.js`. This should give you the message “Server runs properly.”
- In the other terminal direct to `\frontend`, then run `npm start`. After waiting a moment, this should open the website in your browser on `localhost:3002`, if the server has been started by the previous step. 

On how to access the database, as well as possible install requirements, check page 9 of the report.
